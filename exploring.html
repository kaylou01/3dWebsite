        <h2>üê° Puffer Fish</h2>
        <h2>Are they Deadly?</h2>
        <p>
            The toxin in the puffer fish, called tetrodotoxin, is found throughout its body, and is actually produced by bacteria, said Dr. Nick Saint-Erne, Certified Aquatic Veterinarian from PetSmart. Puffers that have been raised in a bacteria-free environment experimentally did not produce the toxin in that instance.

        <h2>A Puffer Fish‚Äôs Teeth Never Stop Growing</h2>
        <p>
            Many fish species have teeth that stop growing at some point, but puffer fish do not. Because they eat hard foods, they have teeth (also called beaks) that continuously grow throughout their lives, said Claricoates. This makes it paramount to offer your puffer fish food with hard shells to help organically trim their teeth. Without snails or the like, your puffer fish may require veterinary dental attention.

        <h2>üßúüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sea Horse</h2>

        <p>
            Seahorses propel themselves by using a small fin on their back that flutters up to 35 times per second. Even smaller pectoral fins located near the back of the head are used for steering.Because of their body shape, seahorses are rather inept swimmers and can easily die of exhaustion when caught in storm-roiled seas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Seahorses prefer to swim in pairs with their tails linked together. They anchor themselves with their prehensile tails to sea grasses and corals, using their elongated snouts to suck in plankton and small crustaceans that drift by. The seahorse can suck up food from as far as 3cm away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seahorses have no teeth and no stomach. Food passes through their digestive systems so quickly, they must eat almost constantly to stay alive. They can consume 3,000 or more brine shrimp per day.

        <h2>ü¶Ä Crabs</h2>

        <p>
            Red crabs are the only species of crabs where both, males and females migrate to breed, whereas in other species, only the females make the long march in order to deposit their fertilized eggs into the sea. These are large crabs, with their carapace measuring up to 4.6 inches wide. The males are usually larger than the females. However, the females have a broader abdomen and smaller claws in comparison. They are bright-red to orange in color. They remain active during the day, but can even die because of dehydration. They usually feed on fresh and dried fallen leaves, fruits, flowers, and seedlings. During the dry weather, they retreat into their shelters to retain moisture and salts in the body.

        <h2>üéêü¶ëüêô Moon jellyfish</h2>

        <br>
                <h2>What type of animal is a moon jellyfish?</h2>
                <p>
                    The moon jellyfish is a type of jellyfish that lives in the ocean. It is an animal that comes under the genus of Aurelia and the Scyphozoa class.
                </p>
                <h2>Where does a moon jellyfish live?</h2>
                <p>
                    The moon jellyfish lives in the ocean. They are found in a wide range of ocean habitats around the world. A moon jellyfish habitat is found along the warm coastlines 0f several oceans such as the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. They usually swim on the surface but whey need to dive, they have the capability to dive up to 90 ft (27.4 m) deep or more.
                </p>
                <h2>How long does a moon jellyfish live?</h2>
                <p>
                    The average moon jellyfish life cycle lasts for between eight to 12 months.
                </p>
                <h2>Are they dangerous?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, the stinging cells of jellyfish are very dangerous, and their tentacles can cause great damage. Luckily though, they are not harmful enough to kill humans. Whilst simply touching a moon jellyfish will not cause great damage, you will still feel a slight sting, so it is best not to touch them! However, the moon jellyfish sting is used for their own protection as well as there are a lot of marine predators who want to devour them. Their oral arms produce a sting that can cause great damage to predators and to humans.
                </p>
                <h2>How big is a moon jellyfish?</h2>
                <p>
                    The moon jellyfish is 3 in (7.6 cm) tall, 2 -15 in (5 - 38 cm) long, and has a tiny weight that is almost negligible. Technically they weigh between 0.005- 0.07 lb (0.224 - 3.2 g).
